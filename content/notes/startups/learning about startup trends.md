## public companies
1. Check financial results and earning calls of public companies that are available on their own website. (information is public, you just need to find it.)
2. be updated about things released by great investors like Larry Fink(Blackrock) to be updated on what type of investments they are doing or have done in past, which resulted in high growth of the company (that can be seen in the financials)
3. **most helpful are [Form S1](sec.gov)**. Every company before going public fills this form and shows the earnings it has done while it was private. In future, everything for the company is released in the earnings call. Some of the websites that are helpful:
	1. [sebi](https://sebi.gov.in)
	2. [sec.gov](https://sec.gov)
	(will extend the list, as i get to know about more websites)
## private companies
need more researching to come up with a good framework to learn.
