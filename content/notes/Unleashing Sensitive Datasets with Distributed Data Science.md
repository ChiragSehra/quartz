### How distributed data science solves the problem?

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Concerns are about **HOW** data is used, not **WHAT** data is used | Usage-based control |
| Released data might be private | Enforce privacy protection |
|Too much data for 1 to team to control| Federated Governance |


### Usage-based access controls

Example: Usage of ML models can be different.
Some users can
- Run training and testing
- run only testing
- Run only queries on the generated results

i.e. Access controls are dependent on the type of usage of the user
