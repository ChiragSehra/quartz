Following are the steps:\n1. **Create a `Dockerfile`**: Crafting a `Dockerfile` that specifies the environment and dependencies required for the Streamlit app.\n```\nFROM python:3.8  \nEXPOSE 8080  \nWORKDIR /app  \nCOPY . ./  \nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt  \nENTRYPOINT [\"streamlit\", \"run\", \"main.py\", \"--server.port=8080\", \"--server.address=0.0.0.0\"]\n```\n\n\n2. **Building the docker image**: Using the docker command line tools, we can build the Docker image of Streamlit app.\n```\ndocker build -t \u003cimage_name\u003e .\n```\n\n3. **Testing the docker container**: We can run the docker container locally to ensure that our Streamlit app works as expected within the containerised environment.\n```\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 \u003cimage_name\u003e\n```\n\n## Setup Google Cloud Run\n1. Open Google Cloud Console: Access the Google Cloud Console using the GCP account.\n2. Enable the Cloud Run API: If you haven't already, enable the Cloud Run API for the GCP account.\n3. Deploy using Cloud Console: Following the Cloud Run Interface to deploy the dockerised streamlit app. We can also set environment variables and CPU limitations.\n```\ngcloud builds submit --tag asia.gcr.io/\u003cPROJECT_ID\u003e/\u003cRANDOM_PROJECT_NAME\u003e \n```\n\n## Deploying the app\n1. Search for `Container Registry` and then you would be able to see the recent container image deployed.\n\n![[notes/images/container_registry_image_list.png]]\n2. Click `Deploy` and select `Deploy to Cloud Run` to deploy the app.\n\n![[notes/images/container_registry_image_deploument.png]]\n3. The app deployment will start and take some time to finish\n\n![[notes/images/cloud_run_app_deployment.png]]\n\n## Testing and Monitoring the App Deployment\nAfter deploying the app, we can test and monitor its usage:\n1. Access the deployed app: Once, the deployment is complete, we receive a URL where the Streamlit app is accessible.\n2. Monitoring and Troubleshooting: Using the Google Cloud Console, we can monitor the app. This includes checking logs, monitoring usage, and identifying any issues that might arise.\n![[notes/images/streamlit_app_monitoring_cloud_run.png]]\n\n## CI/CD\nFor effecient app updates, we can implement CD:\n1. Setting up source control: We can link our Github code repository to Google Cloud Build for automated deployments\n2. Configure Triggers: We can configure triggers to build and deploy our app whenever changes are pushed to the repository\n![[notes/images/streamlit_app_cloud_run_cd.png]]","lastmodified":"2024-11-27T16:45:47.084652762Z","tags":["deployment","streamlit","Google Cloud Run","Serverless Deployment"]},"/notes/Quick-drafts-for-miscellaneous-tech-stuff/Designing-URL-shortening-service-like-TinyURL-or-Bitly":{"title":"Designing URL shortening service like TinyURL or Bitly","content":"It involves several components and considerations to ensure scalability, availability, and performance. Here's a detailed explanation of the design:\n\n![[notes/images/URL Shortner Basic Architecture.excalidraw.png]]\n## Components\n\n1. **Database**: The database is the core of the system, responsible for storing the mapping between short URLs and their corresponding long URLs. It should be highly scalable to handle a large volume of URLs and efficient for quick lookup and insertion operations. A NoSQL database like Redis or Cassandra is suitable for this purpose due to their high performance and scalability.\n2. **Short URL Generator**: This component is responsible for generating unique and short URLs for the input long URLs. It can use various techniques, such as base62 encoding of unique IDs or hashing the long URL. The generated short URL should be easy to remember and share.\n3. **Web Server:** The web server acts as the entry point for the service, handling requests from users to shorten or redirect URLs. It receives the long URL from the user and interacts with the Short URL Generator to generate a short URL or the database to redirect to the corresponding long URL.\n4. **Caching Layer:** A caching layer, typically an in-memory cache like Memcached, can be introduced to improve performance by caching frequently accessed short URL to long URL mappings. This reduces the load on the database and provides faster redirection responses.\n5. **Load Balancer:** To handle increasing traffic and ensure high availability, a load balancer is employed to distribute incoming requests across multiple web servers. This ensures that no single server gets overloaded and maintains consistent performance even during peak traffic.\n\n### Scalability\n\n1. **Horizontal Scaling:** The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more web servers and caching servers. The load balancer will automatically distribute traffic across the additional servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization and handling increased demand.\n    \n2. **Database Sharding:** To further improve scalability of the database, sharding can be implemented. Sharding divides the database into smaller partitions, each responsible for a subset of the data. This reduces the load on individual database servers and improves overall performance.\n    \n\n### Availability\n\n1. **Redundant Web Servers:** To maintain high availability, multiple web servers should be deployed. The load balancer will automatically route traffic to available servers if one server fails, ensuring that the service remains operational even in the event of server failures.\n    \n2. **Database Replication:** Replicating the database across multiple servers ensures that the mapping between short URLs and long URLs remains available even if one database server fails. This ensures data integrity and prevents service disruptions.\n    \n3. **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implementing a monitoring and alerting system is crucial to detect potential issues and proactively address them. This includes monitoring server health, database performance, and error logs to identify potential bottlenecks or failures before they impact users.\n\n### Performance\n\n1. **Caching:** The caching layer significantly improves performance by reducing database load and providing faster redirection responses for frequently accessed short URLs.\n    \n2. **Efficient Database Access:** Optimizing database queries and using appropriate indexes can further improve database performance and reduce latency.\n    \n3. **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Integrating a CDN can further enhance performance by caching static assets, such as images and CSS files, closer to the users' location, reducing load on the origin server and improving page load times.\n    \n\n#### Additional Considerations\n\n1. **Custom URL Aliases:** Allowing users to create custom short URLs for their long URLs can be an added feature, providing personalization and better control over URL branding.\n    \n2. **Click Tracking and Analytics:** Implementing click tracking and analytics can provide valuable insights into user behaviour, popular URLs, and overall service usage.\n    \n3. **Security:** Implementing security measures, such as input validation, URL sanitization, and access control, is essential to protect the service from malicious attacks and data breaches.","lastmodified":"2024-11-27T16:45:47.088652795Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Quick-drafts-for-miscellaneous-tech-stuff/Some-elasticsearch-things-to-remember":{"title":"Troubleshooting elasticsearch deployment for VF ","content":"\nPS: Needs to be converted from PDF to text content.\n![[notes/images/ES Notes Trimmed.pdf]]","lastmodified":"2024-11-27T16:45:47.088652795Z","tags":["elasticsearch"]},"/notes/coding/What-if-data-journey-started-with-an-LLM":{"title":"What if user data journey started with an LLM?","content":"\n\n1. User Interface\n\t1. User logs in the application\n\t2. Dashboard displays options for data onboarding tasks.\n\t3. User selects the desired target database from a pre-configured list (Ex: MYSQL, PostgreSQL, Google BigQuery)\n\t4. Depending on chosen database, the UI dynamically adapts to display relevant data fields specific to database schema\n\t5. Two data input options available: Fill up a form or File Upload.\n2. Data Preprocessing\n\t1. Upon user selection of the target database and data input method, the data is sent securely to the chosen LLM API.\n\t\t1. If form input is chosen in the previous step\n\t\t\t1. LLM analyses each form field and attempts to identify the data type, example: text, number, date)\n\t\t\t2. LLM extracts key information from text fields (e.g name parsing, identifying city etc.)\n\t\t2. If form input is chosen in the previous step\n\t\t\t1. LLM analyses the uploaded file structure (columns, datatypes) and attempts to identify the headers. (if present)\n\t\t\t2. LLM performs basic data cleaning like removing leading/trailing spaces, converting text to lowercase.\n3. Data Mapping\n\t1. Based on LLM analysis, the UI displays a table with 2 sections.\n\t\t1. User data: shows either the pre-populated form fields (with extracted data types) or the first few rows of the uploaded file with identified data types.\n\t\t2. Target Database: Shows the pre-configured schema for the selected database, displaying each column name and data type.\n\t2. LLM suggests potential mappings between user data fields and target database columns based on data type analysis and semantic understanding. These suggests appear as color-coded lines connecting user and database fields (e.g green for confident match, yellow for potential match needing confirmation).\n\t3. User can review and confirm mappings (Drag -drop). LLM highlights any inconsistencies or conflicts (e.g trying to map a text field to a date column)\n\t4. User has the option to manually adjust mappings if LLM suggestions are inaccurate.\n4. Data Transformation\n\t1. Based on the user-confirmed mappings, the transformation happen.\n\t2. Transformation rules are pre-defined based on data types (e.g. converting dates to a specific format, standardising phone number formats etc.)\n\t3. LLM can be used for complex transformations:\n\t\t1. User can flag specific data points for missing values. LLM can suggest potential values based on existing data patterns (with user confirmations)\n\t\t2. Suggest corrections for specific validation errors based on context.\n\t4. Users receive clear error messages with details about any data validations issues encountered. Users can then choose to correct the data or skip specific entries\n5. Database Integration\n\t1. The tool connects to the target database based on pre-configured user credentials.\n\t2. Transformed and validated data is uploaded in batches to the designated table within the user's database.\n6. Success or Error Notification\n\t1. After data upload, the system performs a final validation check on the database side\n\t2. User receives a notification based on the outcome:\n\t\t1. Success: Confirmation message displays of successfully uploaded records. Users can access the data directly within their database.\n\t\t2. Error: Notification details any errors encountered during the upload process. (eg: data format issues etc.) Users can then download an error report with specific details for correction and retry the upload.\n7. Logging and Auditing\n\t1. All user actions, data transformations, and error messages are logged within the application for audit purposes.\n\t2. User can access detailed logs to track their data onboarding tasks and identify any recurring issues.\n8. Additional features to think about later\n\t1. Scheduled data onboarding\n\t2. Customizable data transformation rules\n\t3.
